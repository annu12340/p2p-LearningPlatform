# p2p-LearningPlatform
I have build a peer to peer learning platform, where students learn helping each other out. The platform is build using flask micro-framework. Users can create an account and then they can post their doubts and queries. These doubts are visible to all, and interested peers can it up and solve the issue. On successful completion of the task, a small amount would be given to the person who solves the issue
